Pandas and Numpy\n","\n","Python has several built-in types of data structures such as lists and dictionaries, but none of them allows you to efficiently do computations on large lists or tables of data. The Numpy and Pandas libraries fill this gap by providing 1) specific data structures on which one can efficiently compute and 2) functions to perform the computations on these structures.\n","\n","Numpy is the core scientific computing library on which virtually all other scientific Python packages are building (except for deep learning libraries). This includes notably Scipy, a package offering numerical routines for optimization, regression etc. that will be used in the last series of lectures.\n","\n","Pandas, which itself builds on top of Numpy, is the core data science library on which higher level libraries (e.g. for plotting) are building. \n","\n","Here we briefly present the main data structure offered by Pandas, the **DataFrame** and then show how the data in DataFrames are actually **arrays**, the main data structure of Numpy. This allows us in the next notebooks to explore Numpy before coming back at the end of the course to Pandas.\n","\n","Let's first import both Pandas and Numpy. Both have very commonly used abbreviations ```np``` and ```pd``` that you should use as well to simplify your life. Note that most sub-modules are directly accessible and you won't have to import specific ones as migth be the case for other libraries."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Wj9o0gDqvu3i"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"daLzb8zpxkGZ"},"source":["## Importing data\n","Just like any other library, Pandas offers functionality through the *dot-notation* (as e.g. in ```math.cos()```). When surveying usage of Pandas in places like GitHub, it turns out that the most used function is the one allowing one to import a CSV (comma-separated values).
